# Python Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini projects in Python. Each project is a standalone Python script that demonstrates a specific concept or technique.

## Projects

1. **Menu Driven Program**: A menu driven program that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two numbers.
2. **Fibonacci Up To n**: A program that prints the Fibonacci series up to a given number.
3. **Palindrome and Armstrong**: A program that checks if a given number is a palindrome and an Armstrong number.
4. **Primes Between 11 and 200**: A program that prints all prime numbers between 11 and 200.
5. **Variable Length Sum and Product**: A program that calculates the sum and product of a variable number of arguments.
6. **Diamond Pattern**: A program that prints a diamond pattern of asterisks.
7. **Count Different Things**: A program that counts the number of vowels, consonants, upper case letters, and lower case letters in a given text.
8. **Mam Hates a**: A program that reads a file and writes all lines that do not contain the letter 'a' to a new file.
9. **Binary Search**: A program that performs a binary search on a given list of numbers.
10. **CSV User and Password**: A program that reads a CSV file containing usernames and passwords and checks if a given username and password is valid.
11. **Binary Update Marks**: A program that reads a binary file containing student marks and updates the marks of a given student.
12. **Def Dice**: A program that defines a function that returns a random number between 1 and 6.
13. **CSV Read**: A program that reads a CSV file and prints the contents of a given column.

## Running the Projects
